# Portfolio
 
 ## Description
 
 This is challenge 2 of the bootcamp. I created a portfolio website from scratch using HTML and CSS properties. The header contains flexboxes including my name and a functional nav bar. When clicked, the nav bar will take the user to the specific section pertaining to it. The body includes a hero banner with "my portfolio" subtitle, and 2 additional sections named "about me", and "work". The about me section includes a paragraph in lorem ipsum. The work section includes image placeholders with a hover attribute. The footer contains a "contact me" section that is fully functional. When clicked, each contact me list item will take the user to the specific link pertaining to the topic. I added flexbox to try to make the website responsive with different screen sizes.
